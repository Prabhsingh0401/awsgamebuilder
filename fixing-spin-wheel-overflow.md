## Spin Wheel Overflow Fix

The following changes were made to fix the overflow issues in the spin wheel:

1. Added container controls:
   - Set width: 100% and box-sizing: border-box on the wheel container
   - Added overflow: hidden to prevent content from spilling out

2. Improved wheel wrapper:
   - Added max-width: 600px to limit the overall size
   - Added proper centering with flex display
   - Ensured proper box-sizing

3. Wheel and sections:
   - Set fixed dimensions for the wheel (400px x 400px)
   - Added overflow: hidden to contain section content
   - Properly positioned sections with transform-origin
   - Added text ellipsis for long content in sections

4. Added proper z-indexing:
   - Ensured the pointer stays on top of the wheel
   - Added proper layering for interactive elements

These changes ensure that all content stays within its boundaries while maintaining the functionality and aesthetics of the spin wheel.
